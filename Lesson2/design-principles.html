                    As you can see in the screenshot above, this is the Netflix homepage. Without even really looking into what buttons do what, we can already tell which buttons are more important than the others. Right off the bat, the play button catches our attention first. Then we can see the banner ad for what show or movie they are trying to get us to watch, which then leads to the title of the movie, and then the "More Info" button. We can also see other shows and movies listed below. Because Netflix doesn't care which show or movie we watch, it doesn't make one show more visually appealing than another. This way the attention is given equally between all the thumbnails for the various shows and movies.

                <p>
                    Etsy is known to sell everything under the sun; from jewelry all the way to furniture. Because of it's vast categories of products, it can be overwhelming to decide on what to look at when you're just browsing. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Etsy's homepage and I felt that Etsy did a good job eliminating this process by adding clear and concise filters for different shopping categories using bubbles with images in them. This removed any distracting options and removing the time it would take to make a choice on where to begin looking.

                <p>
                    I have to say, I believe Pinterest is the best representative for the principle of Occam's Razor. When I logged into my pinterest homepage, I forgot how simple and easy scrolling through my feed was. It only offers the viewer posts they would be interested in with decent white space and little clutter. It removes any distraction of ads or buttons and just includes posts and images. If there is a post that interests you, it takes you to an external website. This exemplifies simplicity to the finest degree. And it works, since I don't know anybody who doesn't use pinterest for inspiration.
